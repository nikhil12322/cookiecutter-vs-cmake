# cookiecutter-vs-cmake

A cookiecutter template for creating CMake projects with the same structure as one created with Visual Studio. I created this template so I can move away from Visual Studio. I'm trying to move away from Windows and into Linux, but I need Visual Studio to create CMake projects. I don't need Visual Studio for anything else, so I can use VSCode.

## Requirements

Install `cookiecutter` command line: `pip install cookiecutter`

## Usage

Run `cookiecutter https://github.com/nikhil12322/cookiecutter-vs-cmake`, or if you already ran it: `cookiecutter cookiecutter-vs-cmake`

`project_name` is the name of the project. `same_directories` is to specify whether to place the project and solution in the same directory.
